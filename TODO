Initial goals for specification DSL:

* syntactic segmentation
* specifying grammar and getting things for free (ast holes, choice objects)
* also getting ag-rule stuff for free (ast depth, top-level)
* ability to declare info about grammar pieces -- eg the body of the for loop doesn't increase the depth (or only under certain circumstances), probability skewing for different nodes
* scope graphs for free -- declare that X in the grammar is a binding form, which forms add new scopes, etc


* inline vs separate declarations
** inline makes the grammar definition harder because you have everything up-front, reduced compositionality
** essential stuff wants to be inline, the footnotes want to be separate
