To install, first install Racket.

Then, run `make` from this current directory (where the `xsmith` and
`xsmith-examples` directories live). This will cause the execution of the
`raco pkg install --auto` command in each directory, resulting in the
installation of the `xsmith` and `xsmith-examples` packages in Racket.

After this, you should be able to do `(require xsmith)` in your Racket programs,
and you should also find some provided generators available from the command
line (such as `xsmith-cish` and `xsmith-schemely`).

If you would rather install the packages manually, you can simply `cd` into each
directory and run `raco pkg install --auto` from there.
