  Tactics:
  * Delete (non-binder) list node member
  * Delete unused binder (still not parameter) list node member
  * Replace node with (non-reference) atomic choice
  * Replace reference with most global, first declared definition of same type
  * Recur to children
  * TODO Climbing up after the recursion, search for descendant nodes of the same type, replace node with descendant (IE unwrap the critical section)

  Probably I want to just run each of those down the tree, then re-run the delete unused binder tactic until it fails to make a change.
