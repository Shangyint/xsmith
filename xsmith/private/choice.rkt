Choices for AST growth should be some sort of object.

* They should have some "fresh-me" method that generates a fresh ast-node with appropriate holes, etc.  What exactly it generates could be altered by constraints available.
* They should have some weight score that affects their chances of being chosen.
* They should have an associated set of features that affects (enables/disables)
*   their availability to be chosen.
* They should be able to be refined based on new constraints, and should detect when the choice is no longer possible due to conflicting constraints.
** For some things this could be done by choices having a list of sub-choices that can be filtered, but for others (eg. with large choice spaces) this should happen in some other way.
