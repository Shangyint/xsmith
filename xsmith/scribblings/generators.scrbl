@title[#:tag "running-fuzzers"]{Xsmith's Bundled Generators (And How to Run Them)}

When xsmith is installed as a Racket package, executables for the bundled generators are placed in your Racket package @verb{bin} directory.
Usually this directory is @verb{$HOME/.racket/racket-<version>/bin} on Linux, maybe @verb{$HOME/Library/Racket/<version>/bin} on normal MacOS installs, and maybe @verb{/usr/local/bin} for MacOS Homebrew installs.

These fuzzers can be run on the command line to generate a single program or as an http server that generates one program per request.

Command-line options for bundled Xsmith generators are all the same, and provided by @racket[xsmith-command-line].


@section[#:tag "cish"]{Cish}

Cish is a C program generator made with the Xsmith library.  It has co-evolved with Xsmith, and is essentially the reference Xsmith program generator.

The executable for Cish is called @verb{xsmith-cish}.  Additionally, Cish can be run with the command @verb{racket -l xsmith/cish --} (the final @verb{--} causes further flags to be parsed by cish and not by Racket).

The command-line options available in Cish are:

@(command-line-options-table)

Cish supports the following features for the @verb{--with-<feature>} flags:

@(apply itemlist
(map
(Î» (name default)
@item{@tt{@(symbol->string name)} -- defaults to @(format "~a" default)})
(map first cish-features-list)
(map second cish-features-list)))

To compile cish output, you need to include Csmith's runtime directory in your header path to get safe_math.h.

eg.

@verb{xsmith-cish > cish-output.c && gcc -I $CSMITH_DIR/runtime -o cish-output cish-output.c}


@section[#:tag "schemely"]{Schemely}

The executable for Schemely is called @verb{xsmith-schemely}.  Additionally, Schemely can be run with the command @verb{racket -l xsmith/schemely --} (the final @verb{--} causes further flags to be parsed by cish and not by Racket).

The command-line options available in Schemely are:

@(command-line-options-table)

Schemely currently has no features for the @verb{--with-<feature>} flags.

At the time of writing, Schemely really just supports Racket.  At some future point it should generate portable Scheme code.
