* Version 2.0.2

We resolved some reproducibility issues.  Xsmith now runs reproducibly
between Racket CS and Racket BC, at least on the master branch of Racket.
(Racket 7.9.0.3 after commit 8baf16c093295bde500c9a3b55857ad9c1d85348)

We also improved some of the demo fuzzers.  The racket-kernel-fuzzer
demo actually produces correct code (well, usually at least), and has
started finding bugs.  The other demo fuzzers have not been rigorously
tested yet, so they probably still need their printing adjusted to
have most programs even remotely accepted.

* Version 2.0.0

Second public release.  Gripping news, eh?  Basically everything is much better.

* Version 1.0.0

First public release.
