Before running, xsmith requires various dependencies.  To install
them, either `cd` to the `xsmith/src` directory and run
`raco pkg install` to install xsmith as a racket package (which will
automatically install dependencies), or run
`raco pkg install pprint racr rosette`
to install dependencies manually.

To run Xsmith's C program generator, run `racket xsmith.rkt`.
Add the `--help` flag to see options.

Importantly, to use range domain analysis to remove safe math
operations, use `--with unsafe-math/range`, and similarly for symbolic
interpretation use `--with unsafe-math/symbolic`.  If both are used,
the range domain will be used first.

To compile generated programs, some Csmith headers are required for
the safe math functions used.  Get Csmith from
`https://github.com/csmith-project/csmith/`, build it, and then add
the csmith/runtime directory to your CPATH while compiling.
